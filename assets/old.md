kerberos:
### ðŸ”¹ **Client Side:**

1. Client authenticates with the **Kerberos Authentication Server (AS)** and receives a **Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT)**.
2. Client uses the TGT to request a **Service Ticket (ST)** from the **Ticket Granting Server (TGS)**.
3. Client sends the ST in the **gRPC request** as metadata to the server.

### ðŸ”¸ **Server Side:**

1. **First Request**:
    
    - Server validates the ST locally using the Kerberos shared key (without contacting the KDC).
    - If the ST is valid, process the request.
    - Cache the ST using its expiration time as the TTL.
2. **Subsequent Requests**:
    
    - If the ST is cached and not expired â†’ No need to validate again.
    - If the ST is expired â†’ Request a new ST from the client.
3. **Ticket Renewal (Optional)**:
    - Background worker can pre-fetch renewable tickets to reduce latency when the ticket expires.

oauth:
### ðŸ”¹ **Client Side:**

1. Client authenticates with the **OAuth Authorization Server** and receives an **Access Token** (JWT or opaque).
2. Client includes the token in the **gRPC request** as metadata.

### ðŸ”¸ **Server Side:**

1. **Fetching Signing Keys**:
    
    - On startup, the server fetches the signing keys (via the JWKS endpoint).
    - Cache the keys with a TTL based on the providerâ€™s metadata (or a fixed interval).
2. **First Request**:
    
    - If token is a JWT â†’ Validate locally using the cached signing key.
3. **Subsequent Requests**:  
    âœ… **JWT:**
    
    - If token is a JWT and cached â†’ No need to re-validate.
    - If signature or expiration fails â†’ Reject the request.
    
4. **Key Rotation**:
    - Background worker periodically refreshes signing keys.
    - If the token signature fails due to rotation, re-fetch the keys.

saml:
### ðŸ”¹ **Client Side:**

1. Client logs into the **Identity Provider (IdP)** and receives a **SAML Assertion**.
2. Client sends the assertion in the **gRPC request** as metadata.

### ðŸ”¸ **Server Side:**

1. **Fetching Signing Keys**:
    - On startup, the server fetches the IdPâ€™s signing key (via metadata endpoint).
    - Cache the key and rotate periodically based on IdP metadata.
2. **First Request**:
    
    - Validate the SAML assertionâ€™s signature using the cached key.
    - Verify the `NotOnOrAfter` attribute (expiration).
    - If valid â†’ Convert the assertion into a session token and cache it.
3. **Subsequent Requests**:  
    âœ… If session token is cached and valid â†’ Skip SAML validation.  
    âœ… If assertion is cached and valid â†’ No need to contact IdP.  
    âœ… If session expires â†’ Refresh by validating a new assertion.
    
4. **Session Renewal**:
    - Background worker can refresh long-lived sessions before expiration to avoid latency.
    - If the IdPâ€™s key rotates â†’ Refresh key cache automatically.

- The server periodically refreshes the JWKS key set using a background worker.
- If signature verification fails â†’ Attempt to fetch a fresh key set.
### âœ… **Why Itâ€™s Efficient:**

- JWT = Local validation â†’ No need to contact the provider per request.
- Key rotation is handled in the background â†’ No client-side impact.
## ðŸ”‘ **How Kerberos Works**

1. **Client Authentication Phase**
    
    - The client contacts the **Kerberos Authentication Server (AS)** and requests a **Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT)** by providing credentials (like username and password).
    - The AS encrypts the TGT using the **Kerberos secret key** shared with the **Ticket Granting Server (TGS)** and sends it back to the client.
2. **Service Ticket Request Phase**
    
    - The client sends the TGT to the **TGS** and requests a **Service Ticket (ST)** for the specific service it wants to access (in this case, your server).
    - The TGS issues the ST, encrypted using the **serviceâ€™s shared key** (which is known to both the TGS and the server).
3. **Client Access Phase**
    
    - The client sends the ST to the server in the gRPC request.
    - The server uses its own **Kerberos shared key** (pre-configured during Kerberos setup) to decrypt and validate the ST.
    - If the ticket is valid â†’ The request is authenticated and processed.

## ðŸ”‘ **How SAML Works**

**(Used for Single Sign-On (SSO) in enterprise applications)**

### 1. **Client Authentication Phase**

- The client accesses the service and is redirected to the **Identity Provider (IdP)** (e.g., Okta, Microsoft AD).
- The client logs into the IdP using credentials (e.g., username/password, MFA).
- The IdP verifies the credentials and generates a **SAML Assertion** (an XML document):
    - Signed using the IdPâ€™s private key.
    - Contains user identity, roles, and expiration (`NotOnOrAfter`).
    - Optionally encrypted for added security.

---

### 2. **Assertion Delivery Phase**

- The IdP sends the **SAML Assertion** to the client via a browser redirect (or POST).
- The client forwards the assertion to the server as part of the gRPC request.

---

### 3. **Assertion Validation Phase**

- The server validates the SAML Assertion:  
    âœ… Signature â†’ Validated using the IdPâ€™s public key (retrieved from metadata endpoint).  
    âœ… Expiration â†’ Checked against `NotOnOrAfter` attribute.  
    âœ… User Identity â†’ Extracted and verified against the systemâ€™s expected user state.
    
- If valid â†’ The request is authenticated and processed.
    
- The server caches the decoded assertion using the `NotOnOrAfter` time as the TTL.
    

---

### 5. **Subsequent Requests**

- If the session token is cached â†’ Skip SAML validation.
- If the session expires â†’ Request a new SAML assertion from the client.
- If the IdPâ€™s public key rotates â†’ Refresh keys from the metadata endpoint.

---

### 6. **Key Rotation and Refresh**

- The server periodically refreshes the IdPâ€™s public key using a background worker.
- If signature verification fails â†’ Attempt to refresh the key from the IdP.
- If the key endpoint fails due to rate limiting â†’ Implement exponential backoff.

---

## ðŸ”‘ **How OAuth 2.0 Works**

**(Used for API-based authentication via Identity Providers like Google, Okta, etc.)**

### 1. **Client Authentication Phase**

- The client sends a request to the **OAuth Authorization Server** (e.g., Google, Okta) to initiate the authentication flow.
- The client presents credentials (such as a client ID, client secret, or user password) depending on the grant type:
    - **Authorization Code** â€“ User login with redirection.
    - **Client Credentials** â€“ Machine-to-machine authentication.
    - **Implicit** â€“ Direct client-side token retrieval.
    - **Refresh Token** â€“ Long-term session maintenance.

---

### 2. **Access Token Request Phase**

- If the credentials are valid, the Authorization Server issues an **Access Token**:  
    âœ… If the token is a **JWT** â†’ It is signed using the providerâ€™s private key.  

---

### 3. **Client Access Phase**

- The client includes the **Access Token** in the gRPC request as metadata (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
    
- The server handles the token differently based on its type:  
    âœ… **JWT:**
    
    - The server verifies the tokenâ€™s signature using the providerâ€™s public key (retrieved from the JWKS endpoint).
    - If the signature is valid and the token is not expired â†’ The request is authenticated and processed.
    

### 4. **Subsequent Requests**

- **JWT:**  
    âœ… If the token is cached â†’ Skip verification until expiration.  
    âœ… If signature verification fails â†’ Refresh keys from JWKS endpoint.
    
---

### 5. **Key Rotation and Refresh**

- The server periodically refreshes the JWKS key set using a background worker.
- If signature verification fails â†’ Attempt to fetch a fresh key set.
- If the introspection endpoint fails due to rate limiting â†’ Implement exponential backoff.

---

### âœ… **Why Itâ€™s Efficient:**

- JWT = Local validation â†’ No need to contact the provider per request.
- Key rotation is handled in the background â†’ No client-side impact.
