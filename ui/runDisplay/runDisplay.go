// paginated views for diff view mods chosen w/ keybinds so need T model
// choose method of just spam commands to all async or sequential
// see individual container viewports? -> add later

// choose container, choose runbook mode or ad hoc
// use file picker

// want view of progress bar top, steps w/ command start then scrolling like apt update as stuff continues, emojis for fixing logging as updates, dot progress while running
// this would be for individual containers, can see container name at top, progress for each step, tab between, cancel running, uses sys codes for status

// for all containers section, show each container w/ progress bar loading, maybe step on the side, overall progress at top, need to calculate steps and increase counter based on operations

// [=============================               ]
// :check_mark: Step 1: bash jhljkajsid
// :loading: Step 4: ....

// check package-manager from bubble tea

// bubbles fancy list for container progress-> supposedly can update?

// log progress in file

// exitting: cancel progress w/ ctrl + c, cant move back to earlier step w/o completing or cancelling (cannot be running containers mid way)

// for minimal verbosity, use send-msg example, just stream when containers are done

// tabs for diff views?
// better for side by side...
// runbook and ad-hoc should be identical, except ad-hoc should have text entry to input commands on one "terminal"

// composable views

// composable views example for side-by-side, good to have both views for container script running together

// feedback streaming: sendmsg, TUI daemon combo, realtime, package maanger
